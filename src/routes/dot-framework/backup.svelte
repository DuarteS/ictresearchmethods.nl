<!-- <h1>The DOT Framework</h1>
<h2>Research in ICT</h2>
<p>As a bachelor of ICT, your research aims at creating an ICT product which fits its needs (in this context an ICT product can be a software product, or an ICT design or advise/report). The research is focused on the product, and not per se on creating new knowledge which is the aim in most scientific research.</p>
<p>To give you a glimpse of possible ICT research:</p>
<ul>
	<li>investigating the stakeholders' wishes</li>
	<li>choosing the most appropriate technology for a (part of) ICT system</li>
	<li>investigating the usefulness of a certain technology or framework</li>
	<li>testing the quality of an ICT product</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Development Oriented Triangulation Framework</h2>
<p>
	To help you in your ICT research, we advise the use of the Development Oriented Triangulation (DOT) framework. The DOT framework can help you to structure your research and to communicate about it. The DOT framework consists of three levels:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The "What" of your research (the domains)</li>
	<li></li>
</ul> -->
